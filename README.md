# BTechProject-AttendanceSystem
This was my final year undergraduate project. It was an attendance system based on facial recognition.

These files were salvaged from an older repository that is no longer maintained. 

CUrrently, this repository contains:
The classifier
The pickle file obtained after encoding
The full notebook used to generate encodings and mark attendance.
