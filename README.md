# BTechProject-AttendanceSystem
This was my final year undergraduate project. It was an attendance system based on facial recognition.

These files were salvaged from an older repository that is no longer maintained. 

As of February 7th, 2024 this repository contains the classifier and the pickle file obtained after encoding.
